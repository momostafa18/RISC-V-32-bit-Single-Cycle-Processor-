# RISC-V-32 bit Single Cycle Processor
This project presents the design and implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V processor based on the RV32I base integer instruction set, developed using Verilog HDL. The goal of the project is to provide a clear, modular, and educational RTL-level realization of a RISC-V core, bridging the gap between instruction set architecture (ISA) concepts and practical digital hardware implementation.
The processor is designed following a single-cycle microarchitecture, where each instruction completes all stages of execution—fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back—within a single clock cycle. This architectural choice prioritizes simplicity and clarity, making the design suitable for learning, analysis, and future architectural extensions.
